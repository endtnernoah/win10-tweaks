# 1. PowerToys

PowerToys is a collection of Programs from Microsoft to improve workflow and productivity. It includes many useful things like Smart Zones, a Screen Ruler or a Color Picker. 

PowerToys can be downloaded [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/powertoys/).

# 2. TaskbarX

TaskbarX allows you to customize your Taskbar with way more animation settings, icon centering and a lot of nice options. It can be bought on the Microsoft store for 1.99â‚¬ (if you wan't to support the developer, always a nice thing to do) or it can be downloaded from the creators [github](https://github.com/ChrisAnd1998/TaskbarX).

# 3. WinDynamicDesktop

WinDynamicDesktop allows you to use the official macOS backgrounds. It can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store.

# 4. macOS Cursors (or any other cursor pack)

The macOS cursors I use can be found [here](https://github.com/antiden/macOS-cursors-for-Windows), but any other cursor pack will work. 

To install it, open your Mouse Settings -> Advanced Mouse Options -> Pointers, then replace the default files with the ones you previously downloaded. Make sure to save it as a new Cusor Pack.

# 5. Windows Terminal

The Windows Terminal App found in the Microsoft Store is a necessary upgrade to the default Windows Terminal. When combining it with the next step, WSL and OhMyZsh, it allows you to use the Terminal way more efficient than it would be possible with the default Windows CMD.

# 6. WSL + OMZ

Installing WSL and OMZ seems like quite a scary task, but it's not that difficult. To install WSL, you first need to activate Virtualization in your BIOS. There are no default guides for this, you need to look at the documentation for your BIOS. 

Installing WSL is a lot simpler, a nice article can be found [here](https://pureinfotech.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-2-windows-10/)

After that, you want to look for your desired Distro in the Microsoft Store. I am running Ubuntu LTS 22.04, but there are many other possibilities to choose from.

As the last step, we wan't to install OhMyZSH. It's another shell, just like bash or sh, but it's quite more poreful and can be customized a lot more. 

To install it, take a look [here](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

# 7. Files

Files is a better alternative to the Windows Explorer. You can get it from the Microsoft Store for some small change, or you can download it [here](https://files.community/download)

# 8. ModernFlyouts

ModernFlyouts allows for better looking Notifications. It can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store.

# 9. EarTrumpet

EarTrumpet allows you to control the Audio for your Applications and Devices way easier. It also can be found in the Microsoft Store.
